# ENGR 220 Project 1: Tensile Tester (2022)

I did not realize there was a Stepper library that we were supposed to use, so I wrote my own from the ground up.

This is the code I wrote for this assignment in it's entirety.
It uses the Arduino Uno's PWM generation registers to move the motor and implements a super basic
ISR to handle the e-stop.
